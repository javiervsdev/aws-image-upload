# aws-image-upload

Simple project created to practise Spring Boot and react skill, and learn how to upload and download images to AWS S3.

To create the project I have followed the tutorial from [Amigoscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-hoSg8iRG0&ab_channel=Amigoscode) youtube channel

## Backend

Simple API to upload and download images to AWS S3.

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Spring Boot v3.0.0-SNAPSHOT](https://spring.io/)
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)

## Frontend

To run frontend is necessary go to `src/main/frontend` and run command `npm start`.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## I've learned:

- How to configure and use AWS S3.
- How to communicate backend and frontend.
- A bit of react.js and hooks like userEffect and useState.
- Practise and improve lambda functions knowledge.

## Things to improve:
- Add tests.
- Reload userProfile component when new image is uploaded.
- Use sql or non sql database instead of in memory database.
